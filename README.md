## Configuring

The main config file is located in `/etc/xdg/swaync/config.json`. Copy it over
to your `.config/swaync/` folder to customize without needing root access.

To reload the config, you'll need to run `swaync-client --reload-config`

- `positionX`: `left`, `right` or `center`
- `positionY`: `top` or `bottom`
- `timeout`: uint (Any positive number). The notification timeout for notifications with normal priority
- `timeout-low`: uint (any positive number without decimals). The notification timeout for notifications with low priority
- `timeout-critical`: uint (any positive number without decimals, 0 to disable). The notification timeout for notifications with critical priority
- `keyboard-shortcuts`: `true` or `false`. If control center should use keyboard shortcuts
- `image-visibility`: `always`, `when-available` or `never`. Notification image visiblilty
- `transition-time`: uint (Any positive number, 0 to disable). The notification animation duration
- `notification-window-width`: uint (Any positive number). Width of the notification in pixels
- `hide-on-clear`: bool. Hides the control center after pressing "Clear All"
- `hide-on-action`: bool. Hides the control center when clicking on notification action
- `control-center-margin-top`: uint (Any positive number, 0 to disable). The margin (in pixels) at the top of the notification center
- `control-center-margin-bottom`: uint (Any positive number, 0 to disable). The margin (in pixels) at the bottom of the notification center
- `control-center-margin-right`: uint (Any positive number, 0 to disable). The margin (in pixels) at the right of the notification center
- `control-center-margin-left`: uint (Any positive number, 0 to disable). The margin (in pixels) at the left of the notification center
- `script-fail-notify`: bool. Sends a notification with error message if a script fails

The main CSS style file is located in `/etc/xdg/swaync/style.css`. Copy it over to your `.config/swaync/` folder to customize without needing root access.

## Scripting

Scripting rules and logic:

- <b>Only one</b> script can be fired per notification
- Each script requires `exec` and at least one of the other properties
- All listed properties must match the notification for the script to be ran
- If any of the propeties doesn't match, the script will be skipped
- If a notification doesn't include one of the properties, that property will
be skipped

Notification information can be printed into a terminal by running
`G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all swaync` (when a notification appears).

Config properties:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "example-script": {
      "exec": "Your shell command or script here...",
      "app-name": "Notification app-name Regex",
      "summary": "Notification summary Regex",
      "body": "Notification body Regex",
      "urgency": "Low or Normal or Critical",
      "category": "Notification category Regex"
    }
  }
  other non scripting properties...
}
```

`config.json` example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // This script will only run when Spotify sends a notification containing
    // that exact summary and body
    "example-script": {
      "exec": "~/.config/swaync/myRickRollScript.sh",
      "app-name": "Spotify"
      "summary": "Never Gonna Give You Up",
      "body": "Rick Astley - Whenever You Need Somebody"
    }
  }
  other non scripting properties...
}
```

### Disable scripting

To completely disable scripting, the project needs to be built like so:

```zsh
meson build -Dscripting=false
ninja -C build
meson install -C build
```

## Waybar Example

This example requires `NotoSansMono Nerd Font` to get the icons looking right

Waybar config

```json
  "custom/notification": {
    "tooltip": false,
    "format": "{icon}",
    "format-icons": {
      "notification": "ï‚¢<span foreground='red'><sup>ï‘„</sup></span>",
      "none": "ï‚¢",
      "dnd-notification": "ï‡·<span foreground='red'><sup>ï‘„</sup></span>",
      "dnd-none": "ï‡·"
    },
    "return-type": "json",
    "exec-if": "which swaync-client",
    "exec": "swaync-client -swb",
    "on-click": "swaync-client -t -sw",
    "on-click-right": "swaync-client -d -sw",
    "escape": true
  },
```

Waybar css file

```css
#custom-notification {
  font-family: "NotoSansMono Nerd Font";
}
```
